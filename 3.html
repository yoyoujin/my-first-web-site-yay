    <h2>Our love is great</h2>
    <p>
    I wasn't welcomed there
    They all want me out
    Do I really have the reason or
    Should I just leave
    I said,
    I won't come around here no more
    But take a bit easy on me
    Cause my friends are weirder than me
    You know how we are
    We only
    (Want a little sympathy and hopes)
    Know how to be loved
    We were only
    (Small amount of poison, but not in your blood)
    Taught by great great love
